### Step 1 - One cubic foot of air
The box floating in front of you contains one cubic foot of air.

You can move your head or walk closer for a better view.

When you're ready to see what's inside, Air tap or say "Next."

### Step 2 - Nitrogen
The majority of air is Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas that is important to plant growth.

When you're ready to continue, Air tap or say "Next."

### Step 3 - Oxygen
The next most abundant gas is Oxygen. Animals and humans breathe it and plants produce it as a byproduct of photosynthesis.

### Step 4 - Argon
Argon, a gas which undergoes almost no chemical reactions, makes up almost 1% of the atmosphere. It has no biological function, but we use it in lasers and lighting.

Together these three gasses make up over 99% of the atmosphere.

### Step 5 - Carbon Dioxide today
Now we've come to Carbon Dioxide, which is the molecule CO2. The purple box contains the current amount of CO2 that's in one cubic foot of air. 

Carbon dioxide is used by all plants, as it's a necessary ingredient for photosynthesis.

The gasses in air are all transparent to visible light, but some gasses, like CO2 are not transparent to infrared light. Infrared is the kind of light which we feel as heat, but can't see. The sun gives off half its energy as infrared.

Carbon dioxide is very effective at absorbing infrared light, which raises its temperature, which then heats up the other gasses in the air.

This property makes CO2 a greenhouse gas.

### Step 6 - CO2 moves adjacent to Air cube
This tiny concentration of CO2 is enough to keep the earth from being an ice planet.

Unfortuantely, even small changes in this amount can warm or cool the entire atmosphere.

If we think about Earth's atmosphere, it seems really big, so how can humans be changing it?

### Step 7 - One gallon gas can
Here's one example: this is one gallon of gasoline and it contains about 1 pound of hydrogen and about 5.3 pounds of carbon.

It gets burned with oxygen from the air and primarily creates water vapor (H2O) from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the carbon.

You should take a step back before saying "Next" or Air tapping.

### Step 8 - 165 cu. ft. of CO2
Burning this one gallon of gasoline produces 18.9 pounds of carbon dioxide gas. This is enough gas to completely fill the giant purple cube with 165 cubic feet of CO2.

This amount of carbon dioxide is enough to double the current CO2 concentration in 406,000 cubic feet of air, which is the volume of a large school gymnasium.

Burning fossil fuels is one of the primary ways in which we're changing our planet's atmosphere.

### Step 9 - CO2 last 180 years
Now let's look at how overall CO2 has changed during modern history. For the past several thousand years there was this much carbon dioxide in the air. It began to grow to the current level around 180 years ago and half of the growth has happened in the last 33 years.

Walk forward or step back to advance or rewind time and see how the CO2 concentration has changed.

### Step 10 - CO2 versus temperature from ice cores
Scientists have drilled ice cores in Antarctica and found layers of ice dating back 800,000 years. They have analysed the air trapped in gas bubbles in the ice and are able to measure the atmospheric composition over this vast time. There have been eight ice ages in this period, and the lowest CO2 levels were the amount in the smallest purple bar, which happened during the coldest parts of the ice ages.

During the warm periods between ice ages, Carbon Dioxide peaked at the level we had 180 years ago before we began increasing it.

Evidence from the ice cores also indicates that there has been an average temperature difference in Antarctica of about 16 degrees between the coldest part of ice ages and the warmest times during interglacial periods.

Again, you can walk forward or step back to advance or rewind time and see how the CO2 concentration has changed.

 If we had no CO2 at all, plants couldn't live, and the earth would average about 57 degrees colder.


Since anatomically modern humans emerged about 200,000 years ago, we are able to see how the atmosphere has been for the entire existance of our species

### Background for Step 10
![Storyboard Ice Core Historic Co2 Temp](Images/3.5-storyboard_ice_core_historic_co2_temp.jpg)

***TBD*** *Notes: ice ages were ~185 ppm CO2 at lowest and 9 deg C colder than interglacial warming peaks of 280 ppm; industrialization started at a 280 ppm peak*


### Step TBD (or only include in interactive experience) - Water Vapor
Water is constantly cycling through the atmosphere. Water evaporates from the Earth's surface and rises on warm updrafts into the atmosphere. It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow.

Water in gaseous form is called Water Vapor.

Air contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere.

Water vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Heat radiated from Earth's surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions.
