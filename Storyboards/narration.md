### One cubic foot of air
The box floating in front of you contains one cubic foot of air.

You can move your head or walk closer for a better view.

When you're ready to see what's inside the box, say "Next".

### Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Argon
The majority of air is Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas that is important to plant growth.

When you're ready to continue, say "Next".

The next most abundant gas is Oxygen. Animals and humans breathe it and plants produce it as a byproduct of photosynthesis.

Argon, a gas which undergoes almost no chemical reactions, makes up almost 1% of the atmosphere. It has no biological function, but we use it in lighting and lasers.

### Water Vapor
Water is constantly cycling through the atmosphere. Water evaporates from the Earth's surface and rises on warm updrafts into the atmosphere. It condenses into clouds, is blown by the wind, and then falls back to the Earth as rain or snow.

Water in gaseous form is called Water Vapor.

Air contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere.

Water vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Heat radiated from Earth's surface is absorbed by water vapor molecules in the lower atmosphere. The water vapor molecules, in turn, radiate heat in all directions.

Together these four gasses make up over 99% of the atmosphere.

### Carbon Dioxide now and historically
Now we come to Carbon Dioxide, which is the molecule CO2: one carbon atom with two oxygen atoms attached. The purple box contains the current amount of CO2 that's in one cubic foot of air. 

Carbon dioxide is used by all plants, as it's a necessary ingredient for photosynthesis.

The gasses in air are all transparent to visible light, but some gasses, like CO2 are not transparent to infrared light, which is the light which we can't see but we feel as heat.

The sun gives off half its energy as infrared light.

Carbon dioxide is very effective at absorbing this infrared light, which raises its temperature, which then heats up the other gasses in the air.

This property makes CO2 a greenhouse gas.

Without this greenhouse effect, Earth would be an ice planet with an average temperature of zero degrees fahrenheit. This small amount of greenhouse gas is enough to warm the earth to the current 57 degree average and increa

For the past several thousand years, there was this much CO2.

It began to grow to the current level around 180 years ago and half of the total growth has happened in the last 33 years.

### CO2 versus temperature from ice cores

***TBD*** *Notes: ice ages were ~185 ppm CO2 at lowest and 9 deg C colder than interglacial warming peaks of 280 ppm; industrialization started at a 280 ppm peak*

### Burning one gallon of gasoline
The atmosphere seems really big, how could humans be changing it?

Here's one example: this is one gallon of gasoline and it contains about 1 pound of hydrogen and about 5.3 pounds of carbon.

It gets combusted with oxygen from the air and primarily creates water vapor (H2O) from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the carbon|

Burning this one gallon of gasoline produces 18.9 pounds of carbon dioxide gas. This is enough gas to fill 165 cubic feet completely with CO2.

 This amount of carbon dioxide is enough to double the current CO2 concentration in 406,000 cubic feet of air.
